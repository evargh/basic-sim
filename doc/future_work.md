# Future work

The backlog of additional work that can be done on the `basic-sim` module:

* Flowlet routing arbiter
* Long-living TCP application and scheduler
* Add filter to interface (link) utilization tracker

When upgrading to a new version of ns-3, be sure to check:

* `PointToPointAbHelper` still consistent with the code in `PointToPointHelper`
