# Utilization tracking

This tracks the utilization of point-to-point network devices / links.

It encompasses the following files:

* `model/core/ptop-utilization-tracker.cc/h` - Utilization tracker
* `helper/core/ptop-utilization-tracker-helper.cc/h` - Helper to install the utilization trackers on the network devices in a topology.

You can use the application(s) separately, or make use of the helper which requires a topology (which is recommended).

## Helper information

You MUST set the following key in `config_ns3.properties` for utilization tracking to be enabled:

* `enable_link_utilization_tracking` : True iff link utilization tracking on all links should be enabled (boolean value, either `true` or `false`)
* `link_utilization_tracking_interval_ns` : The aggregation interval, this effectively determines the granularity of the utilization results. Setting it too low will cause a lot of overhead, setting it too high will make the results less fine. (positive integer value in nanoseconds)


**The utilization log files**

There are two log files generated by the run in the `logs_ns3` folder within the run folder:

* `utilization.csv` : CSV formatted utilization at the interval level. The format is as follows:

  ```
   <from>,<to>,<interval start (ns)>,<interval end (ns)>,<amount of busy in this interval (ns)>
  ```

* `utilization_compressed.csv` : CSV formatted utilization at the interval level, but adjacent intervals with the same utilization (approximately) are joined together. Particularly handy for plotting. The format is as follows:

   ```
   <from>,<to>,<interval start (ns)>,<interval end (ns)>,<amount of busy in this interval (ns)>
   ```

* `utilization_compressed.txt` : Human readable table showing utilization at the interval level, but compressing together the adjacent intervals which have the same utilization (approximately).

* `utilization_summary.txt` : Human readable table of the mean utilization of each link
